Hi it's me Oscar Ma, sorry for this being so late I have really bad time management skills
lets move onto the info stuff

Q: Why did you choose the approach you did?
A: "Thats a little bit vague but I chose the amount of classes and what to put in each class basically just 
    from the insturctions part where it identifies the 'problems', each repsonsiblity made sense to me and
    I thought it felt perfect to have each one be its own class"  


Q: What alternatives did you consider?
A: "I originally before i fully read the instructions consider having the savingOrderToDatabase function inside 
    the OrderManager class as well, just cause that was just what I orignally thought naturally made sense, I'm glad 
    I didn't though, I think have it in its own class follow the Single Responsibility Principle better. "  


Q: What was the most difficult part of the assignment??
A: "The hardest part for me was just reviewing the OrderProcessor class, it was infact really dense and not well organized
    or easily readable. Everything was also so densly commented it that it actually kinda made reviewing it harder, once 
    I understood everything the assignment became very comfortable "
